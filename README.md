# Data Structures & Algorithms Repository

This repository documents my learning and practice journey in **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.

## Repository Structure

Each folder includes:

1. **Code Implementations** – Core implementations of Data Structures & Algorithms I've used and practiced.  
2. **Problems Folder** – Contains code solutions to DSA problems I’ve solved.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to strengthen my understanding of DSA concepts, improve logic building, and prepare for coding interviews.

## Topics Covered So Far

# Data Structures
- Arrays
- Linked Lists  
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees: Linked Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree

# Algorithms
- Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Count Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Selection Sort


## Problems Covered So Far

- Check for Balanced Parentheses  
- Implement Stack using Arrays & Linked List
- Implement Queue using Arrays & Linked List
- Infix to Postfix

*I’ll keep updating this repository as I learn and solve more DSA problems.*
